Local app to keep track of cryptocurrency markets

## Motivation

**Goal**

My goal is to create a local app that anyone can use to monitor and make trades on multiple markets. Using api keys from those markets just like others apps out there, except that the keys are local and not on someone elses server.

## Status

`Just started it`
